## Task

Implement a GitHub Action helping us to guide repository access in a structured way. Employees use this repository to open issues and by such request access to certain repositories. As the process all employees follow is:

1. Open an issue on GitHub on this repository (using the GitHub issue template)
2. The issue title must start with "Requesting access to <additional information>"
3. Users assign a label called "Repository Access"
4. Within the body of the issue employees list the following
   - What repository to gain access to
   - Reason why access is needed
   - What kind of access they require (read, write or admin)
   - If the access should be granted limited or unlimited

Given this information the GitHub Action should to the following:

Validate the required information and add an additional comment if the label "Repository Access" exists and any of the following requirements are not met
   - The issue title doesn't start with the expected message
   - The why, what and timespan questions are not answered

In this case the comment should be:

```txt
ðŸ‘‹ Hi,

you seem to request access to a certain repository but the issue lacks information.
Please add the additional information missing:

1. What repository
2. Reason for access
2. Kind of access
3. Duration of access

Thanks,
your Developer IT Team
```

At the same time the GitHub Action should assign the label "Awaiting Input" to the issue.

If all validation passes the GitHub Action should comment on the issue with the following text:

```txt
ðŸ‘‹ Hi,

thanks for requesting access to a repository.
We will process your request as soon as possible.

Please have a look @developer-it

Thanks,
your Developer IT Team
```

At the same time the GitHub Action should assign the label "Awaiting Approval" to the issue.
